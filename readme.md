# Stock Analysis with Moving Average (MA) Crossover Strategies

To see the project you can open the ‘Stock_Analysis_with_Moving_Average_Crossover_Strategies.ipynb’ file.

## About
The focus of this report is to find out how simple trading strategies work in the stock market 
for future investment opportunities.

I would like to give some information on the method I used for this project. It is the moving average method which is a trend following strategy. Trend following trading strategies assume that price of a stock will continue to move in the same direction it is currently trending.
 
This kind of system tries to take advantage of ups and downs in the market, to make profit and prevent any possible loss.
